## Task Runner

This project uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just) as its task runner. Always prefer `just` recipes over raw commands (e.g., `just build` instead of `cargo build`).

Run `just` with no arguments to list all available recipes.

### Common recipes

```bash
just build        # Build
just test         # Test (pass args: just test -- --nocapture)
just lint         # Lint (fmt check + clippy)
just fmt          # Format code
just check        # cargo check
just install      # Build release binary and symlink to ~/bin/brain
just clean        # cargo clean
```

## Task Management

This project uses `brain` for task tracking. **Always use MCP tools for task operations** — they provide structured responses and are the canonical interface for AI agents. CLI commands exist for human terminal use only.

### MCP Tools (preferred for AI agents)

When running as an MCP server (`brain mcp`), these tools are available:

**Task tools:**
- `tasks_apply_event` — Single tool for all task mutations. Event types: `task_created`, `task_updated`, `status_changed`, `dependency_added`, `dependency_removed`, `comment_added`, `label_added`, `label_removed`, `note_linked`, `note_unlinked`, `parent_set`. Accepts task ID as full ID or unique prefix (e.g. `BRN-01JPH`).
- `tasks_list` — List tasks filtered by status: `open` (default, excludes done), `ready` (no unresolved deps), `blocked` (has unresolved deps), `done`. Supports `task_ids` array for batch lookup, `limit` for pagination, `include_description` flag, and per-field filters: `priority` (0-4), `task_type`, `assignee`, `label`, `search` (FTS5 full-text search on title+description).
- `tasks_get` — Get full task details including relationships, comments, labels, and linked notes. Use `expand` parameter (`parent`, `children`, `blocked_by`, `blocks`) to inline related task objects.
- `tasks_next` — Get highest-priority ready tasks sorted by priority then due date. Use for "what should I work on?" queries.
- `tasks_close` — Close one or more tasks by ID/prefix. Accepts a single string or array of task IDs. Returns closed tasks and newly unblocked task IDs.
- `tasks_labels_summary` — Get all unique labels with counts and associated task IDs (short prefixes). No parameters. Use for label discovery and taxonomy overview.
- `tasks_labels_batch` — Batch label operations. Actions: `add` (label + task_ids), `remove` (label + task_ids), `rename` (old_label + new_label), `purge` (label). Returns succeeded/failed/summary.
- `tasks_deps_batch` — Batch dependency operations. Actions: `add`/`remove` (pairs of task_id + depends_on_task_id), `chain` (ordered task_ids), `fan` (source_task_id + dependent_task_ids), `clear` (task_id). Returns succeeded/failed/summary.

**Memory tools:**
- `memory_search_minimal` — Semantic search across indexed notes. Returns compact stubs (title, summary, score). Use `intent` parameter to control ranking: `lookup` (keyword-heavy), `planning` (recency + links), `reflection` (recency-heavy), `synthesis` (vector-heavy). Optional `tags` array boosts results matching the given tags via Jaccard similarity (e.g. `["rust", "memory"]`).
- `memory_expand` — Expand stubs from `search_minimal` to full content by chunk ID. Use `budget` to control token limit. Returns `byte_start`/`byte_end` offsets within the source file for each chunk.
- `memory_write_episode` — Record structured episodes (goal, actions, outcome) with tags and importance score.
- `memory_reflect` — Retrieve source material for a topic, suitable for reflection and synthesis.

### CLI Commands (for human terminal use)

```

### Finding Work

When the user asks what to work on next (e.g., "what's next?", "what should I work on?", "next task", "any work?"), always check brain tasks first:
1. Use `tasks_next` MCP tool to get unblocked tasks sorted by priority
2. Present the top candidates with their ID, title, priority, and type
3. If a task has dependencies, briefly note what's blocking it

### Workflow

When working on tasks:
1. **Before starting**: Mark the task `in_progress` via `tasks_apply_event` (status_changed)
2. **While working**: Add comments via `tasks_apply_event` (comment_added) for significant decisions or blockers
3. **On completion**: Close the task via `tasks_apply_event` (status_changed to `done`)

**Important**: Always close tasks when work is complete. If the brain MCP server is unavailable, fall back to the CLI: `brain tasks close <id>`

**Cross-task insights**: If you discover during work on one task that something affects or should be captured on a different task, immediately add a comment to that task with the relevant context. Don't defer — the insight is freshest now and costs seconds to capture vs. minutes to reconstruct later.

**Planning references**: When planning work, always reference the task ID(s) being planned for and any related tasks that may be affected. This creates a traceable link between plans and the work they address, and helps future agents (or humans) understand why decisions were made.

### Conventions

- **Priority scale**: 0=critical, 1=high, 2=medium, 3=low, 4=backlog
- **Task types**: task, bug, feature, epic, spike
- **Statuses**: open, in_progress, blocked, done, cancelled

## Keeping AGENTS.md in sync

This file is the canonical reference for all AI agents working on this codebase (Claude Code, Cursor, Zed, Copilot, Windsurf). CLAUDE.md is a thin bridge that points here. When making changes that affect the documented surface area, **update this file as part of the same commit**:

- **MCP tool changes** (new tools, renamed tools, new/changed parameters, changed return shapes) → update the **MCP Tools** section above
- **CLI command changes** (new subcommands, changed flags, removed commands) → update the **CLI Commands** section above
- **Task runner changes** (new/renamed `just` recipes) → update the **Common recipes** section above
- **Workflow or convention changes** (new statuses, priority scale changes, new task types) → update the **Conventions** / **Workflow** sections above

If unsure whether a change warrants a docs update, err on the side of updating — stale docs cause more harm than verbose docs.
